To configure the builder globally, you can use `setConfig()` method:

```js
import { setConfig } from 'cloudinary-builder-url'

setConfig({
  cloudName: 'your-cloud-name',
})
```

To configure the builder per url generation call, you can use `cloud` field of `options` parameter of that call.

```js
import { buildImageUrl } from 'cloudinary-builder-url'

const src = buildImageUrl('public-id', {
  cloud: {
    cloudName: 'your-cloud-name',
  }
})
```

## Cloudinary options

* Type: `CloudConfig`

### `cloudName`

* Type: `String`
* **Required**

The cloud name associated with your Cloudinary account. It is used to configure and enable Cloudinary features such as generating delivery asset URL. 

```js
import { setConfig } from 'cloudinary-builder-url'

setConfig({
  cloudName: 'your-cloud-name',
})
```

Cloud name presents in every delivered URL from Cloudinary, hence it's important to have it configured correctly.

You can find your cloud name details in **Dashboard** page, or in **Account Settings** page in [Cloudinary console](https://cloudinary.com/console)

</alert>

### `secure`

* Type: `Boolean`
* Default: `true`

Force secure HTTPS delivery urls for all assets (images + videos) generated by Cloudinary, even if they are embedded in HTTP originally.

  secureDistribution: 'your-custome-domain-name'
})
```
